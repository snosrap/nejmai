We present a compelling case for the incorporation of lived experience into biomedical research and advocate the integration of AI \u2014 particularly large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 \u2014 to bridge this epistemological gap. When paired with sophisticated natural language processing techniques, LLMs could systematically analyze qualitative data from disconnected electronic health record data. We explore methodologic use cases \u2014 including grounded theory and thematic analysis \u2014 while addressing the challenges of analytical fidelity and bias reduction with continuous human oversight. We suggest that AI-augmented qualitative research can uncover hidden insights from a multitude of disparate datasets, revealing patient experiences that would otherwise remain inaccessible. This integrated approach could enrich the understanding of health and disease, while ensuring it is as inclusive and reflective of human complexity as the lives it seeks to understand and improve.</div>"
