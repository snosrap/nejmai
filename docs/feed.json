It provides a framework of how RAG works and describes its strengths and weaknesses when applied to the field of medicine.",

However, their inherent\nlimitations, such as the need for up-to-date information, hallucinations of\nincorrect facts, and a reliance on public-domain data, restrict the full\npotential of generative AI within the health care setting.

Foundation\nmodels are built for multipurpose use, enabling them to perform tasks even\nwhen not specifically pretrained for them, and to adapt to different clinical\napplications.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe present VisionFM, an artificial intelligence foundation model for\nophthalmology pretrained on 3.4 million images from over 500,000 individuals,\ncovering diverse ophthalmic diseases, imaging modalities and devices, and\nclinical scenarios. Pretrained based on eight modalities, VisionFM was tested\nfor multiple applications, including disease screening and detection,\nprognosis and prediction, and segmentation of lesions and anatomical\nstructures, on an ophthalmic database comprising 53 public and 12 private\ndatasets. We compared the model against ophthalmologists with varying\nexperience in ophthalmic and systemic disease diagnoses.\n\n### Results\n\nVisionFM outperformed baseline deep learning approaches in diagnosing ocular\ndiseases, achieving an average area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.950 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.941 to\n0.959) across eight disease categories and five imaging modalities in internal\nvalidation.

In a comparative study of\ndiagnostic accuracy of 12 ocular diseases from fundus photographs, VisionFM\nshows diagnostic accuracy close to that of intermediate-level\nophthalmologists. Its generalizability extends to new imaging modalities and\ndevices, effectively handling dataset shifts. For example, VisionFM accurately\ngraded diabetic retinopathy with an AUROC of 0.935 (95% CI, 0.902 to 0.964)\nusing an imaging modality it was never exposed to during pretraining.\nFurthermore, VisionFM is able to predict both glaucoma progression and the\npresence of intracranial tumors directly from fundus photographs.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nVisionFM provides an efficient platform for diagnosis or prediction of\nmultiple diseases using multiple imaging modalities and is scalable to\nincorporate additional data, modalities, and applications via its open-sourced\nmodel weights and codebase.

We compared the model against ophthalmologists with varying experience in ophthalmic and systemic disease diagnoses.</div></section><section id=\"abs-sec-3\"><h3>Results</h3><div role=\"paragraph\">VisionFM outperformed baseline deep learning approaches in diagnosing ocular diseases, achieving an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.950 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.941 to 0.959) across eight disease categories and five imaging modalities in internal validation. In external validation, VisionFM achieved an AUROC of 0.945 (95% CI, 0.934 to 0.956) in fundus-based diabetic retinopathy recognition, and an AUROC of 0.974 (95% CI, 0.966 to 0.983) in optical coherence tomography\u2013based age-related macular degeneration recognition. In a comparative study of diagnostic accuracy of 12 ocular diseases from fundus photographs, VisionFM shows diagnostic accuracy close to that of intermediate-level ophthalmologists. Its generalizability extends to new imaging modalities and devices, effectively handling dataset shifts. For example, VisionFM accurately graded diabetic retinopathy with an AUROC of 0.935 (95% CI, 0.902 to 0.964) using an imaging modality it was never exposed to during pretraining. Furthermore, VisionFM is able to predict both glaucoma progression and the presence of intracranial tumors directly from fundus photographs.</div></section><section id=\"abs-sec-4\"><h3>Conclusions</h3><div role=\"paragraph\">VisionFM provides an efficient platform for diagnosis or prediction of multiple diseases using multiple imaging modalities and is scalable to incorporate additional data, modalities, and applications via its open-sourced model weights and codebase.
