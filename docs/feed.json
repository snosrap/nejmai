      "summary": "Despite its growing prevalence, chronic liver disease remains underdiagnosed, with notable morbidity and mortality. In this article, an AI algorithm screens for chronic liver diseases in patients undergoing transthoracic echocardiography studies, using standard subcostal images routinely obtained to evaluate the inferior vena cava.",
      "content_text": "## Abstract\n\n### Background\n\nChronic liver disease (CLD) affects more than 1.5 billion adults, most of whom\nare asymptomatic and undiagnosed. Echocardiography is broadly performed and\nvisualizes the liver, but this information is not clinically leveraged for CLD\ndiagnosis.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe developed and evaluated EchoNet-Liver, a deep-learning, computer-vision\npipeline that can identify high-quality subcostal images from full\nechocardiogram studies and detect the presence of cirrhosis and steatotic\nliver disease (SLD). This retrospective observational study included adult\npatients from two large urban academic medical centers who received both\nechocardiography and abdominal imaging \u2014 either ultrasound or magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) \u2014 within 30 days. The model predictions were compared\nwith diagnoses from clinical evaluations of paired abdominal ultrasound or MRI\nstudies.\n\n### Results\n\nA total of 1,596,640 echocardiogram videos from 66,922 studies and 24,276\npatients at Cedars\u2013Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) were used to develop EchoNet-\nLiver. In a held-out CSMC test cohort, EchoNet-Liver detected cirrhosis with\nan area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.837\n(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.828 to 0.848) and SLD with an AUROC of 0.799\n(95% CI, 0.788 to 0.811). In a separate test cohort with paired abdominal MRI\nstudies, EchoNet-Liver detected cirrhosis with an AUROC of 0.704 (95% CI,\n0.699 to 0.708) and SLD with an AUROC of 0.725 (95% CI, 0.707 to 0.762). In an\nexternal test cohort of 106 patients (5280 videos), the model detected\ncirrhosis with an AUROC of 0.830 (95% CI, 0.799 to 0.859) and SLD with an\nAUROC of 0.769 (95% CI, 0.733 to 0.813).\n\n### Conclusions\n\nDeep-learning assessment of clinical echocardiography enables opportunistic\nscreening for SLD and cirrhosis. The application of this algorithm can\nidentify patients who may benefit from further diagnostic testing and\ntreatment for CLD.

Our objective was to\nexamine the impact of implementing an artificial intelligence (AI)\u2013informed ED\ntriage tool on triage performance and patient flow.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe performed a multisite quality improvement study of an AI-informed triage\nclinical decision support (CDS) intervention. The CDS tool provided\nindividualized triage recommendations and rationale based on the predicted\nrisk of acute outcomes. Comparative analyses were conducted for 180 days\npreintervention versus postintervention, and across nurses exhibiting high and\nlow levels of agreement with the CDS. Patient-centered performance outcomes\nand ED flow measures were examined and adjusted for potential confounders.\n\n### Results\n\nA total of 174,648 ED visits (83,404 visits preintervention and 91,244\npostintervention) were included across three EDs. The triage acuity\ndistribution changed postintervention; low-acuity (level 4 or 5) visits\nincreased 48.2% (23.9 to 35.4%), mid-acuity (level 3) visits decreased 18.7%\n(48.8 to 39.7%), and high-acuity (level 1 or 2) visits decreased 8.8% (27.3 to\n24.9%). Following the intervention there was an increase in high-acuity\nidentification (level 1 or 2 assignment) of patients requiring critical care\n(from 78.8% [95% confidence interval, 76.4 to 80.8%] to 83.1% [80.9 to 85.0%];\nP<0.001) and no observed change in identification of emergency surgery\npostintervention (41.2% [37.8 to 43.7%] to 39.2% [36.4 to 41.5%]; P=0.16).\nHospitalization rates among low-acuity patients were maintained (below 4%)\npostintervention. Variability in nurse agreement with the AI-informed triage\nCDS and triage performance was observed; the nurse subgroup with a high rate\nof agreement performed better than the AI independently, whereas those with\nlower rates of agreement performed worse. The AI triage CDS intervention was\nassociated with reductions in median times from arrival to the initial care\narea (33.0%; 12.0 to 8.0 minutes), ED disposition (4.2%; 190.0 to 182.0\nminutes), and to ED departure (6.1%; 311.0 to 292.0 minutes).\n\n### Conclusions\n\nImplementation of an AI-informed triage CDS system was associated with\nimproved triage performance and ED patient flow.

AI centers of excellence based in LMICs can serve as focal points, providing guidance and stewardship on how to address the challenges while harvesting the benefits of generative AI.</div>"

      "summary": "An examination of how commercial influences in health care AI \u2014 such as decision support manipulation, market concentration, and exploitative practices \u2014 reveals risks of misaligning care with patient and societal needs. This perspective advocates for comprehensive oversight and, where appropriate and necessary, regulatory frameworks to protect patient-centered care while fostering innovation and competition.",
