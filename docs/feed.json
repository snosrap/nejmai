While\nechocardiography is the standard assessment method, assessment via left\nventriculography during angiography is often done and carries procedural\nrisks. The CathEF algorithm uses deep learning to estimate LVEF directly from\nroutine left coronary angiograms without additional contrast injection or\nprocedural risks. The CathEF study is a prospective, multicenter,\nobservational study of 207 patients from two Canadian institutions undergoing\ncoronary angiography for ACS. The diagnostic performance of CathEF was\nevaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity; metrics were compared with\nechocardiography and ventriculography. The AUROC for the CathEF algorithm was\n0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 0.89) in identifying LVEF less\nthan or equal to 50%, and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86 to 0.96) in identifying LVEF less\nthan or equal to 40%. Performance was reduced in patients with ST-elevation\nmyocardial infarction (STEMI) (AUROC, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.88) and those\nwith right coronary artery involvement (AUROC, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.86). In\nsummary, the CathEF algorithm offers a reliable, noninvasive tool for real-\ntime screening for LV systolic dysfunction during coronary angiography in\npatients with ACS.

While echocardiography is the standard assessment method, assessment via left ventriculography during angiography is often done and carries procedural risks. The CathEF algorithm uses deep learning to estimate LVEF directly from routine left coronary angiograms without additional contrast injection or procedural risks. The CathEF study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study of 207 patients from two Canadian institutions undergoing coronary angiography for ACS. The diagnostic performance of CathEF was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity; metrics were compared with echocardiography and ventriculography. The AUROC for the CathEF algorithm was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 0.89) in identifying LVEF less than or equal to 50%, and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86 to 0.96) in identifying LVEF less than or equal to 40%.
