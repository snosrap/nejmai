      "summary": "The Clinical Behavioral Atlas, a pioneering computer vision system tailored for the intensive care unit setting, is capable of automatically detecting a broad range of clinically relevant activities, objects, and personnel categories through RGB video data, making strides in ICU observational research.",
      "content_text": "## Abstract\n\n### Background\n\nWhile computer vision has gained traction in medical applications, models\nspecifically engineered for intensive care unit (ICU) activities are limited.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe present Clinical Behavioral Atlas (CBA), a computer vision system that can\nidentify 40 clinically relevant activity categories and 55 object categories\nsolely through RGB video data. The system was developed using a dataset\ncomprising over 140,000 hours of continuous video and over 350,000 densely\nannotated frames, collected from 16 sensors in 8 ICU rooms at an academic\nmedical center.\n\n### Results\n\nThe model demonstrated strong performance in entity and activity detection,\nwith sensitivities of 0.75\u223c0.81 and average precisions of 0.64\u223c0.73,\nrespectively. Permutation tests yielded P values of less than 0.05 for most\nactivity categories. We observed a positive correlation between the\nperformance and both the number and size of entities. The model excelled at\nidentifying common and large objects, even with limited samples, but struggled\nwith small items like oral swabs. Activity detection performance correlated\nlinearly with video duration. The model showed robust performance (>0.85\naverage precision) for most clinical activities, but activities of daily\nliving exhibited greater variation and lower average precision (0.23\u20130.95),\nindicating potential for further refinement due to their complexity and\nrelative scarcity in the dataset. Experiments against other popular activity\nrecognition models reveal that our method substantially outperforms all\nbaselines, with improvements of 0.30 and 0.45 in average precision over the\nnext best method.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nCBA expands automated identification of clinically important bedside clinical\nactions such as ICU preventive bundle elements. While we have demonstrated the\nfeasibility of computer vision as a tool to assist in clinical care in high-\nintensity settings such as the ICU, the development of a full clinical-level\nperformance CBA model will require larger datasets, ideally from multiple\nlocations.

      "content_html": "<h2 property=\"name\">Abstract</h2><section id=\"abs-sec-1\"><h3>Background</h3><div role=\"paragraph\">While computer vision has gained traction in medical applications, models specifically engineered for intensive care unit (ICU) activities are limited.</div></section><section id=\"abs-sec-2\"><h3>Methods</h3><div role=\"paragraph\">We present Clinical Behavioral Atlas (CBA), a computer vision system that can identify 40 clinically relevant activity categories and 55 object categories solely through RGB video data. The system was developed using a dataset comprising over 140,000 hours of continuous video and over 350,000 densely annotated frames, collected from 16 sensors in 8 ICU rooms at an academic medical center.</div></section><section id=\"abs-sec-3\"><h3>Results</h3><div role=\"paragraph\">The model demonstrated strong performance in entity and activity detection, with sensitivities of 0.75\u223c0.81 and average precisions of 0.64\u223c0.73, respectively. Permutation tests yielded P values of less than 0.05 for most activity categories. We observed a positive correlation between the performance and both the number and size of entities. The model excelled at identifying common and large objects, even with limited samples, but struggled with small items like oral swabs. Activity detection performance correlated linearly with video duration. The model showed robust performance (&gt;0.85 average precision) for most clinical activities, but activities of daily living exhibited greater variation and lower average precision (0.23\u20130.95), indicating potential for further refinement due to their complexity and relative scarcity in the dataset. Experiments against other popular activity recognition models reveal that our method substantially outperforms all baselines, with improvements of 0.30 and 0.45 in average precision over the next best method.</div></section><section id=\"abs-sec-4\"><h3>Conclusions</h3><div role=\"paragraph\">CBA expands automated identification of clinically important bedside clinical actions such as ICU preventive bundle elements. While we have demonstrated the feasibility of computer vision as a tool to assist in clinical care in high-intensity settings such as the ICU, the development of a full clinical-level performance CBA model will require larger datasets, ideally from multiple locations.
