We randomly assigned\nparticipants to one of five conditions. In four conditions, they were told an\nAI system was used. Either AI agreed with the radiologist, also failing to\nfind pathology (AI agree), or AI did find pathology (AI disagree). Some\nparticipants were given more context about the performance of AI: a 1% AI\nfalse omission rate (FOR) was presented when AI agreed with the radiologist\u2019s\nfinding (noted as AI agree + FOR), and a 50% AI false discovery rate (FDR) was\npresented when the AI disagreed with the radiologist\u2019s finding (noted as AI\ndisagree + FDR).

Using MIDAS, the authors evaluate the diagnostic performance of leading AI models and compare them with dermatologists\u2019 diagnoses, highlighting the need for diverse, real-world data to improve model generalizability and clinical relevance of AI use in dermatologic diagnostics.",
      "content_text": "## Abstract\n\n### Background\n\nWith an estimated 3 billion people lacking dermatologic care globally,\nartificial intelligence (AI) offers potential improvements in access. However,\nhigh-quality, diverse datasets are crucial for developing and testing these\nalgorithms, including both unimodal and multimodal approaches. Most\ndermatology AI models are built on proprietary, siloed data, often from a\nsingle site with a single image type (i.e., clinical or dermoscopic). To\naddress this, we introduce the Melanoma Research Alliance Multimodal Image\nDataset for AI-based Skin Cancer (MIDAS), the largest publicly available,\nprospectively recruited dataset of biopsy-proven skin lesions with paired\ndermoscopic and clinical images.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe evaluated model performance on real-world MIDAS cases using four previously\npublished state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and compared model and clinician\ndiagnostic performance. We also assessed algorithm performance using clinical\nphotography taken at different distances from the lesion to assess its\ninfluence across diagnostic categories.\n\n### Results\n\nWe prospectively enrolled 796 patients through an institutional review\nboard\u2013approved protocol with informed consent, representing 1290 unique\nlesions and 3830 total images (including dermoscopic and clinical images taken\nat 15-cm and 30-cm distances), to build MIDAS. The images represented a\ndiverse range of lesions seen in general dermatology, including malignant,\nbenign, and inflammatory types. Among these were melanocytic nevi (22.4%),\ninvasive cutaneous melanomas (4.4%), and melanomas in situ (4.5%). We observed\nperformance reduction across all the dermatology SOTA models compared with\ntheir previously published metrics. As a baseline, dermatologists achieved 79%\naccuracy in identifying malignant lesions, and dermoscopic images yielded\nhigher sensitivity than clinical ones.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nImproving our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of AI diagnostic\nalgorithms is critical as these tools advance toward widespread clinical\ndeployment. While many models report high performance, caution is warranted\ndue to a lack of model transportability across different patient populations.\nMIDAS\u2019s robust, multimodal dataset allows researchers to evaluate models on\nreal-world images, better assessing their generalizability and helping to\nbridge the gap between performance and clinical applicability.

However, high-quality, diverse datasets are crucial for developing and testing these algorithms, including both unimodal and multimodal approaches. Most dermatology AI models are built on proprietary, siloed data, often from a single site with a single image type (i.e., clinical or dermoscopic). To address this, we introduce the Melanoma Research Alliance Multimodal Image Dataset for AI-based Skin Cancer (MIDAS), the largest publicly available, prospectively recruited dataset of biopsy-proven skin lesions with paired dermoscopic and clinical images.</div></section><section id=\"abs-sec-2\"><h3>Methods</h3><div role=\"paragraph\">We evaluated model performance on real-world MIDAS cases using four previously published state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and compared model and clinician diagnostic performance. We also assessed algorithm performance using clinical photography taken at different distances from the lesion to assess its influence across diagnostic categories.</div></section><section id=\"abs-sec-3\"><h3>Results</h3><div role=\"paragraph\">We prospectively enrolled 796 patients through an institutional review board\u2013approved protocol with informed consent, representing 1290 unique lesions and 3830 total images (including dermoscopic and clinical images taken at 15-cm and 30-cm distances), to build MIDAS. The images represented a diverse range of lesions seen in general dermatology, including malignant, benign, and inflammatory types. Among these were melanocytic nevi (22.4%), invasive cutaneous melanomas (4.4%), and melanomas in situ (4.5%). We observed performance reduction across all the dermatology SOTA models compared with their previously published metrics. As a baseline, dermatologists achieved 79% accuracy in identifying malignant lesions, and dermoscopic images yielded higher sensitivity than clinical ones.</div></section><section id=\"abs-sec-4\"><h3>Conclusions</h3><div role=\"paragraph\">Improving our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of AI diagnostic algorithms is critical as these tools advance toward widespread clinical deployment. While many models report high performance, caution is warranted due to a lack of model transportability across different patient populations. MIDAS\u2019s robust, multimodal dataset allows researchers to evaluate models on real-world images, better assessing their generalizability and helping to bridge the gap between performance and clinical applicability.
