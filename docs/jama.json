            "content_html": "<h3>Importance</h3><p>Individuals with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) often report vision problems despite having normal visual acuity and fundus examinations. Diagnostics are needed for these patients.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To determine if a battery of assessments or machine-learning approaches can aid in diagnosing visual dysfunction in patients with mild TBI.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>This prospective, observational, case-control study was conducted between May 2018 and November 2021. The study setting was at a level 1 trauma research hospital. Participant eligibility included adult males and females with recorded best-corrected visual acuity and normal fundus examination. Individuals in the case group had a history of mild TBI; controls had no history of TBI. Exclusion criteria included a history of ocular, neurological, or psychiatric disease, moderate-severe TBI, recent TBI, metal implants, age younger than 18 years, and pregnancy. Cases and controls were sex- and age-matched. Data analysis was performed from July 2023 to March 2024.</p><h3>Exposures</h3><p>History of mild TBI in the case group.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>The single-session visit included the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory and measurements of oculomotor function, optical coherence tomography, contrast sensitivity, visual evoked potentials, visual field testing, and magnetic resonance imaging.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>A total of 28 participants (mean [SD] age, 35.0 [12.8] years; 15 male [53.6%]) with mild TBI and 28 controls (mean [SD] age, 35.8 [8.5] years; 19 female [67.9%]) were analyzed. Participants with mild TBI showed reduced prism convergence test breakpoint (\u22128.38; 95% CI, \u221214.14 to \u22122.62;<i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.008) and recovery point (\u22128.44; 95% CI, \u221213.82 to \u22123.06;<i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.004). Participants with mild TBI also had decreased contrast sensitivity (\u22120.07; 95% CI, \u22120.13 to \u22120.01;<i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.04) and increased visual evoked potential binocular summation index (0.32; 95% CI, 0.02-0.63;<i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.02). A subset of participants exhibited reduced peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, increased optic nerve/sheath size, and brain cortical volumes. Machine learning identified subtle differences across the primary visual pathway, including the optic radiations and occipital lobe regions, independent of visual symptoms.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Results of this case-control study suggest that the visual system was affected in individuals with mild TBI, even in those who did not self-report vision problems. These findings support the utility of a battery of assessments or machine-learning approaches to accurately diagnose this population.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h3>IMPORTANCE</h3><p>Understanding the association of artificial intelligence (AI) with physician burnout is crucial for fostering a collaborative interactive environment between physicians and AI.</p><h3>OBJECTIVE</h3><p>To estimate the association between AI use in radiology and radiologist burnout.</p><h3>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS</h3><p>This cross-sectional study conducted a questionnaire survey between May and October 2023, using the national quality control system of radiology in China. Participants included radiologists from 1143 hospitals. Radiologists reporting regular or consistent AI use were categorized as the AI group. Statistical analysis was performed from October 2023 to May 2024.</p><h3>EXPOSURE</h3><p>AI use in radiology practice.</p><h3>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES</h3><p>Burnout was defined by emotional exhaustion (EE) or depersonalization according to the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Workload was assessed based on working hours, number of image interpretations, hospital level, device type, and role in the workflow. AI acceptance was determined via latent class analysis considering AI-related knowledge, attitude, confidence, and intention. Propensity score\u2013based mixed-effect generalized linear logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between AI use and burnout and its components. Interactions of AI use, workload, and AI acceptance were assessed on additive and multiplicative scales.</p><h3>RESULTS</h3><p>Among 6726 radiologists included in this study, 2376 (35.3%) were female and 4350 (64.7%) were male; the median (IQR) age was 41 (34-48) years; 3017 were in the AI group (1134 [37.6%] female; median [IQR] age, 40 [33-47] years) and 3709 in the non-AI group (1242 [33.5%] female; median [IQR] age, 42 [34-49] years). The weighted prevalence of burnout was significantly higher in the AI group compared with the non-AI group (40.9% vs 38.6%;<i>P</i>\u2009&lt;\u2009.001). After adjusting for covariates, AI use was significantly associated with increased odds of burnout (odds ratio [OR], 1.20; 95% CI, 1.10-1.30), primarily driven by its association with EE (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.34). A dose-response association was observed between the frequency of AI use and burnout (<i>P </i>for trend\u2009&lt;\u2009.001). The associations were more pronounced among radiologists with high workload and lower AI acceptance. A significant negative interaction was noted between high AI acceptance and AI use.</p><h3>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE</h3><p>In this cross-sectional study of radiologist burnout, frequent AI use was associated with an increased risk of radiologist burnout, particularly among those with high workload or lower AI acceptance. Further longitudinal studies are needed to provide more evidence.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h3>Importance</h3><p>Understanding the outcomes of artificial light at night (ALAN) on insomnia is crucial for public health, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions. However, evidence of the association between ALAN exposure and insomnia is limited, despite the large number of people exposed to ALAN.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To explore the association between outdoor ALAN exposure and insomnia among the Chinese population.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>This cross-sectional study used social media data from Weibo (Sina), a social media platform, and satellite-derived nighttime light images. The study period spans from May 2022 to April 2023. The study encompasses 336 cities across China\u2019s mainland, providing a comprehensive national perspective. Data include insomnia-related posts from the platform users, representing a large and diverse population sample exposed to varying levels of ALAN.</p><h3>Exposure</h3><p>Outdoor ALAN exposure (in nanowatts per centimeters squared per steradian [nW/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr]) was measured using satellite-derived nighttime light images at a spatial resolution of 500 m.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>The incidence of insomnia among residents at the city level was measured by the number of insomnia-related posts on social media. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate the association between ALAN exposure and population insomnia, adjusting for population characteristics and meteorological factors at the city level.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The study included data from 1\u202f147\u202f583 insomnia-related posts. Daily mean ALAN exposure across the 336 cities ranged from 3.1 to 221.0 nW/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr. For each 5 nW/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr increase in ALAN exposure, the incidence of insomnia increased by 0.377% (95% CI, 0.372%-0.382%). The association was greater in less populated cities and under extreme temperature and poor air quality conditions. The observed exposure-response functions between ALAN exposure and insomnia demonstrated an upward trend, with steeper slopes observed at low exposures and leveling off at higher exposures.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>This study provides evidence of the association between increased ALAN exposure and higher incidence of insomnia. These findings expand the current knowledge on adverse health outcomes of ALAN exposure and emphasize the potential health benefits of well-planned artificial nighttime lighting in China and other developing countries in the early stages of city planning.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h3>Importance</h3><p>The results of prediction models that stratify patients with sepsis and risk of resistant gram-negative bacilli (GNB) infections inform treatment guidelines. However, these models do not extrapolate well across hospitals.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To assess whether patient case mix and local prevalence rates of resistance contributed to the variable performance of a general risk stratification GNB sepsis model for community-onset and hospital-onset sepsis across hospitals.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>This was a retrospective cohort study conducted from January 2016 and October 2021. Adult patients with sepsis at 10 acute-care hospitals in rural and urban areas across Missouri and Illinois were included. Inclusion criteria were blood cultures indicating sepsis, having received 4 days of antibiotic treatment, and having organ dysfunction (vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, increased creatinine or bilirubin levels, and thrombocytopenia). Analyses were completed in April 2024.</p><h3>Exposure</h3><p>The model included demographic characteristics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory values, procedures, and medications administered.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>Culture results were stratified for ceftriaxone-susceptible GNB (SS), ceftriaxone-resistant but cefepime-susceptible GNB (RS), and ceftriaxone- and cefepime-resistant GNB (RR). Negative cultures and other pathogens were labeled SS. Deep learning models were developed separately for community-onset (patient presented with sepsis) and hospital-onset (sepsis developed \u226548 hours after admission) sepsis. The models were tested across hospitals and patient subgroups. Models were assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under precision recall curve (AUPRC).</p><h3>Results</h3><p>A total of 39\u202f893 patients with 85\u202f238 sepsis episodes (43\u202f207 [50.7%] community onset; 42\u202f031 [48.3%] hospital onset) were included. Median (IQR) age was 65 (54-74) years, 21\u202f241 patients (53.2%) were male, and 18\u202f830 (47.2%) had a previous episode of sepsis. RS contributed to 3.9% (1667 episodes) and 5.7% (2389 episodes) of community-onset and hospital-onset sepsis episodes, respectively, and RR contributed to 1.8% (796 episodes) and 3.9% (1626 episodes), respectively. Previous infections and exposure to antibiotics were associated with the risk of resistant GNB. For example, in community-onset sepsis, 375 RR episodes (47.1%), 420 RS episodes (25.2%) and 3483 of 40\u202f744 (8.5%) SS episodes were among patients with resistance to antimicrobial drugs (P\u2009&lt;\u2009.001). The AUROC and AUPRC results varied across hospitals and patient subgroups for both community-onset and hospital-onset sepsis. AUPRC values correlated with the prevalence rates of resistant GNB (<i>R</i>\u2009=\u20090.79;<i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.001).</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>In this cohort study of 39\u202f893 patients with sepsis, variable model performance was associated with prevalence rates of antimicrobial resistance rather than patient case mix. This variability suggests caution is needed when using generalized models for predicting resistant GNB etiologies in sepsis.</p>",

Deploying the NYHA model among 182\u202f308 unannotated notes from the 3 sites identified 23\u202f830 (13.1%) notes with NYHA mentions, specifically 10\u202f913 notes (6.0%) with class I, 12\u202f034 notes (6.6%) with classes II or III, and 883 notes (0.5%) with class IV. An additional 19\u202f730 encounters (10.8%) could be classified into functional status groups based on activity- or rest-related symptoms, resulting in a total of 43\u202f560 medical notes (23.9%) categorized by NYHA, an 83% increase compared with explicit mentions alone.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>In this diagnostic study of 34\u202f070 patients with HF, the NLP approach accurately extracted a patient\u2019s NYHA symptom class and activity- or rest-related HF symptoms from clinical notes, enhancing the ability to track optimal care delivery and identify patients eligible for clinical trial participation from unstructured documentation.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h3>Importance</h3><p>Prompt and accurate diagnosis of arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AAION) from giant cell arteritis and other systemic vasculitis can contribute to preventing irreversible vision loss from these conditions. Its clinical distinction from nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) can be challenging, especially when systemic symptoms are lacking or laboratory markers of the disease are not reliable.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To develop, train, and test a deep learning system (DLS) to discriminate AAION from NAION on color fundus images during the acute phase.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>This was an international study including color fundus images of 961 eyes of 802 patients with confirmed AAION and NAION. Training was performed using images from 21 expert neuro-ophthalmology centers in 16 countries, while external testing was performed in a cohort from 5 expert neuro-ophthalmology centers in the US and Europe. Data for training and external testing were collected from August 2018 to January 2023. A mix of deidentified images of 2 fields of view (optic disc centered and macula centered) were used. For training and internal validation, images were from 16 fundus camera models with fields of 30\u00b0 to 55\u00b0. For external testing, images were from 5 fundus cameras with fields of 30\u00b0 to 50\u00b0. Data were analyzed from January 2023 to January 2024.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>The performance of the DLS was measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>In the training and validation sets, 374 (54.9%) of patients were female, 301 (44.2%) were male, and 6 (0.9%) were of unknown sex; the median (range) age was 66 (23-96) years. When tested on the external dataset including 121 patients (35 [28.9%] female, 44 [36.4%] male, and 42 [34.7%] of unknown sex; median [range] age, 69 [37-89] years), the DLS achieved an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.99), a sensitivity of 91.1% (95% CI, 85.2-96.9), a specificity of 93.4% (95% CI, 91.1-98.2), and an accuracy of 92.6% (95% CI, 90.5-96.6). The accuracy of the 2 experts for classification of the same dataset was 74.3% (95% CI, 66.7-81.9) and 81.6% (95% CI, 74.8-88.4), respectively.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>A DLS showing disease-specific averaged class-activation maps had greater than 90% accuracy at discriminating between acute AAION from NAION on color fundus images, at the eye level, without any clinical or biomarker information. A DLS that identifies AAION could improve clinical decision-making, potentially reducing the risk of misdiagnosis and improving patient outcomes.</p>",

Using remote video conferencing and in-person participation across multiple academic medical institutions, physicians with training in family medicine, internal medicine, or emergency medicine were recruited.</p><h3>Intervention</h3><p>Participants were randomized to either access the LLM in addition to conventional diagnostic resources or conventional resources only, stratified by career stage. Participants were allocated 60 minutes to review up to 6 clinical vignettes.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>The primary outcome was performance on a standardized rubric of diagnostic performance based on differential diagnosis accuracy, appropriateness of supporting and opposing factors, and next diagnostic evaluation steps, validated and graded via blinded expert consensus. Secondary outcomes included time spent per case (in seconds) and final diagnosis accuracy. All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. A secondary exploratory analysis evaluated the standalone performance of the LLM by comparing the primary outcomes between the LLM alone group and the conventional resource group.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Fifty physicians (26 attendings, 24 residents; median years in practice, 3 [IQR, 2-8]) participated virtually as well as at 1 in-person site. The median diagnostic reasoning score per case was 76% (IQR, 66%-87%) for the LLM group and 74% (IQR, 63%-84%) for the conventional resources-only group, with an adjusted difference of 2 percentage points (95% CI, \u22124 to 8 percentage points;<i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.60). The median time spent per case for the LLM group was 519 (IQR, 371-668) seconds, compared with 565 (IQR, 456-788) seconds for the conventional resources group, with a time difference of \u221282 (95% CI, \u2212195 to 31;<i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.20) seconds. The LLM alone scored 16 percentage points (95% CI, 2-30 percentage points;<i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.03) higher than the conventional resources group.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>In this trial, the availability of an LLM to physicians as a diagnostic aid did not significantly improve clinical reasoning compared with conventional resources. The LLM alone demonstrated higher performance than both physician groups, indicating the need for technology and workforce development to realize the potential of physician-artificial intelligence collaboration in clinical practice.</p><h3>Trial Registration</h3><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT06157944</p>",

Multiple-choice responses were marked as correct based on the ground-truth, correct answer. Free-text responses were rated by a team of oncology specialists in duplicate and marked as correct based on consensus or resolved by a review of a third oncology specialist.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>This study evaluated 10 chatbots, including 3 multimodal and 7 unimodal chatbots. On the multiple-choice evaluation, the top-performing chatbot was chatbot 10 (57 of 79 [72.15%]), followed by the multimodal chatbot 2 (56 of 79 [70.89%]) and chatbot 5 (54 of 79 [68.35%]). On the free-text evaluation, the top-performing chatbots were chatbot 5, chatbot 7, and the multimodal chatbot 2 (30 of 79 [37.97%]), followed by chatbot 10 (29 of 79 [36.71%]) and chatbot 8 and the multimodal chatbot 3 (25 of 79 [31.65%]). The accuracy of multimodal chatbots decreased when tested on cases with multiple images compared with questions with single images. Nine out of 10 chatbots, including all 3 multimodal chatbots, demonstrated decreased accuracy of their free-text responses compared with multiple-choice responses to questions about cancer cases.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>In this cross-sectional study of chatbot accuracy tested on clinical oncology cases, multimodal chatbots were not consistently more accurate than unimodal chatbots. These results suggest that further research is required to optimize multimodal chatbots to make more use of information from images to improve oncology-specific medical accuracy and reliability.</p>",

This Special Communication reviews the history of the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) regulation of AI; presents potential uses of AI in medical product development, clinical research, and clinical care; and presents concepts that merit consideration as the regulatory system adapts to AI\u2019s unique challenges.</p><h3>Observations</h3><p>The FDA has authorized almost 1000 AI-enabled medical devices and has received hundreds of regulatory submissions for drugs that used AI in their discovery and development. Health AI regulation needs to be coordinated across all regulated industries, the US government, and with international organizations. Regulators will need to advance flexible mechanisms to keep up with the pace of change in AI across biomedicine and health care. Sponsors need to be transparent about and regulators need proficiency in evaluating the use of AI in premarket development. A life cycle management approach incorporating recurrent local postmarket performance monitoring should be central to health AI development. Special mechanisms to evaluate large language models and their uses are needed. Approaches are necessary to balance the needs of the entire spectrum of health ecosystem interests, from large firms to start-ups. The evaluation and regulatory system will need to focus on patient health outcomes to balance the use of AI for financial optimization for developers, payers, and health systems.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Strong oversight by the FDA protects the long-term success of industries by focusing on evaluation to advance regulated technologies that improve health. The FDA will continue to play a central role in ensuring safe, effective, and trustworthy AI tools to improve the lives of patients and clinicians alike. However, all involved entities will need to attend to AI with the rigor this transformative technology merits.</p>",

The key question the authors set out to answer was whether the models would produce images that accurately reflect the actual racial, ethnic, and gender composition of the US physician workforce, or whether the models would demonstrate biased performance. One important aspect of the study method was that the authors used relatively open-ended prompts, including \u201cPhoto of a physician in the United States,\u201d allowing the machinations of the AI to produce an image that it determined was most likely to meet the needs of the end user. AI tools powered by large language models, including the ones examined in the study, use a degree of randomness in their outputs, so models are expected to produce different images in response to each prompt\u2014but how different would the images be? Their findings are striking. First, although 63% of US physicians are White, the models produced images of White physicians 82% of the time. 1 Additionally, several models produced no images of Asian or Latino physicians despite nearly a third of the current physician workforce identifying as a member of these groups. The models also severely underrepresented women in their outputs, producing images of women physicians only 7% of the time. These results demonstrate a clear bias in outputs relative to actual physician demographics. But what do these findings mean for AI and its use in medicine?",

            "content_html": "<h3>Importance</h3><p>This review aims to assess the benefits and risks of implementing large language model (LLM) solutions in an academic surgical setting.</p><h3>Observations</h3><p>The integration of LLMs and artificial intelligence (AI) into surgical practice has generated international attention with the emergence of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard. From an administrative standpoint, LLMs have the potential to revolutionize academic practices by reducing administrative burdens and improving efficiency. LLMs have the potential to facilitate surgical research by increasing writing efficiency, building predictive models, and aiding in large dataset analysis. From a clinical standpoint, LLMs can enhance efficiency by triaging patient concerns and generating automated responses. However, challenges exist, such as the need for improved LLM generalization performance, validating content, and addressing ethical concerns. In addition, patient privacy, potential bias in training, and legal responsibility are important considerations that require attention. Research and precautionary measures are necessary to ensure safe and unbiased use of LLMs in surgery.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Although limitations exist, LLMs hold promise for enhancing surgical efficiency while still prioritizing patient care. The authors recommend that the academic surgical community further investigate the potential applications of LLMs while being cautious about potential harms.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h3>Importance</h3><p>Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has reached an all-time high, and health care leaders across the ecosystem are faced with questions about where, when, and how to deploy AI and how to understand its risks, problems, and possibilities.</p><h3>Observations</h3><p>While AI as a concept has existed since the 1950s, all AI is not the same. Capabilities and risks of various kinds of AI differ markedly, and on examination 3 epochs of AI emerge. AI 1.0 includes symbolic AI, which attempts to encode human knowledge into computational rules, as well as probabilistic models. The era of AI 2.0 began with deep learning, in which models learn from examples labeled with ground truth. This era brought about many advances both in people\u2019s daily lives and in health care. Deep learning models are task-specific, meaning they do one thing at a time, and they primarily focus on classification and prediction. AI 3.0 is the era of foundation models and generative AI. Models in AI 3.0 have fundamentally new (and potentially transformative) capabilities, as well as new kinds of risks, such as hallucinations. These models can do many different kinds of tasks without being retrained on a new dataset. For example, a simple text instruction will change the model\u2019s behavior. Prompts such as \u201cWrite this note for a specialist consultant\u201d and \u201cWrite this note for the patient\u2019s mother\u201d will produce markedly different content.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Foundation models and generative AI represent a major revolution in AI\u2019s capabilities, ffering tremendous potential to improve care. Health care leaders are making decisions about AI today. While any heuristic omits details and loses nuance, the framework of AI 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 may be helpful to decision-makers because each epoch has fundamentally different capabilities and risks.</p>",

This poses an urgent threat toward public health initiatives and calls for rapid attention by health care professionals, AI developers, and regulators to ensure public safety.</p><h3>Observations</h3><p>As an example, using a single publicly available large-language model, within 65 minutes, 102 distinct blog articles were generated that contained more than 17\u202f000 words of disinformation related to vaccines and vaping. Each post was coercive and targeted at diverse societal groups, including young adults, young parents, older persons, pregnant people, and those with chronic health conditions. The blogs included fake patient and clinician testimonials and obeyed prompting for the inclusion of scientific-looking referencing. Additional generative AI tools created an accompanying 20 realistic images in less than 2 minutes. This process was undertaken by health care professionals and researchers with no specialized knowledge in bypassing AI guardrails, relying solely on publicly available information.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>These observations demonstrate that when the guardrails of AI tools are insufficient, the ability to rapidly generate diverse and large amounts of convincing disinformation is profound. Beyond providing 2 example scenarios, these findings demonstrate an urgent need for robust AI vigilance. The AI tools are rapidly progressing; alongside these advancements, emergent risks are becoming increasingly apparent.

            "content_html": "<h3>Importance</h3><p>Nomenclature in the field of neurodegenerative diseases presents a challenging problem. Inconsistent use of terms such as<i>Alzheimer disease</i>and<i>dementia</i>has compromised progress in clinical care, research, and development of therapeutics. Dementia-associated stigma further contributes to inconsistent and imprecise language. The result is a lack of clarity that produces confusion with patients and the general public and presents communication challenges among researchers. Therefore, the Advisory Council on Research, Care, and Services of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer\u2019s Disease authorized a committee to make recommendations for improvement.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To establish a systematic neurodegenerative disease framework for information collection and communication to standardize language usage for research, clinical, and public health purposes.</p><h3>Evidence Review</h3><p>The Dementia Nomenclature Initiative organized into 3 major stakeholder working groups: clinicians, researchers, and the public (including individuals living with dementia and family caregivers). To inform the work, the initiative completed a narrative literature review of dementia nomenclature evolution over the last century across the PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Scopus databases (January 1, 2000, through July 31, 2020). Initiative working groups used the results as a foundation for understanding current challenges with dementia nomenclature and implications for research, clinical practice, and public understanding. The initiative obtained additional input via focus groups with individuals living with dementia and caregivers, with separate groups for race and ethnicity (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, and White) as an initial assessment of the meaning of dementia-related terms to these groups.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>From working group deliberations, the literature review, and focus group input, the initiative developed a framework clearly separating the clinical syndromic presentation experienced by affected individuals from possible underlying pathophysiologies. In the framework, domains of clinical impairment, such as cognitive, behavioral, motor, and other neurologic features, are graded by level of impairment between none and severe. Next, biomarker information describes underlying disease processes, explains the syndrome, and identifies possible disease labels: Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies, or vascular cognitive impairment dementia.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>The Dementia Nomenclature Initiative established a framework to guide communication about cognitive impairment among older adults. Wider testing and refinement of the framework will subsequently improve the information used in communicating about cognitive impairment and the way in which the information is used in clinical, research, and public settings.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h3>Importance</h3><p>Red blood cell transfusion is a common medical intervention with benefits and harms.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To provide recommendations for use of red blood cell transfusion in adults and children.</p><h3>Evidence Review</h3><p>Standards for trustworthy guidelines were followed, including using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methods, managing conflicts of interest, and making values and preferences explicit. Evidence from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials was reviewed.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>For adults, 45 randomized controlled trials with 20\u202f599 participants compared restrictive hemoglobin-based transfusion thresholds, typically 7 to 8 g/dL, with liberal transfusion thresholds of 9 to 10 g/dL. For pediatric patients, 7 randomized controlled trials with 2730 participants compared a variety of restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds. For most patient populations, results provided moderate quality evidence that restrictive transfusion thresholds did not adversely affect patient-important outcomes. Recommendation 1: for hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, the international panel recommends a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). In accordance with the restrictive strategy threshold used in most trials, clinicians may choose a threshold of 7.5 g/dL for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and 8 g/dL for those undergoing orthopedic surgery or those with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Recommendation 2: for hospitalized adult patients with hematologic and oncologic disorders, the panel suggests a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL (conditional recommendations, low certainty evidence). Recommendation 3: for critically ill children and those at risk of critical illness who are hemodynamically stable and without a hemoglobinopathy, cyanotic cardiac condition, or severe hypoxemia, the international panel recommends a restrictive transfusion strategy considering transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Recommendation 4: for hemodynamically stable children with congenital heart disease, the international panel suggests a transfusion threshold that is based on the cardiac abnormality and stage of surgical repair: 7 g/dL (biventricular repair), 9 g/dL (single-ventricle palliation), or 7 to 9 g/dL (uncorrected congenital heart disease) (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>It is good practice to consider overall clinical context and alternative therapies to transfusion when making transfusion decisions about an individual patient.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h3>Importance</h3><p>Artificial intelligence (AI), driven by advances in deep learning (DL), has the potential to reshape the field of cardiovascular imaging (CVI). While DL for CVI is still in its infancy, research is accelerating to aid in the acquisition, processing, and/or interpretation of CVI across various modalities, with several commercial products already in clinical use. It is imperative that cardiovascular imagers are familiar with DL systems, including a basic understanding of how they work, their relative strengths compared with other automated systems, and possible pitfalls in their implementation. The goal of this article is to review the methodology and application of DL to CVI in a simple, digestible fashion toward demystifying this emerging technology.</p><h3>Observations</h3><p>At its core, DL is simply the application of a series of tunable mathematical operations that translate input data into a desired output. Based on artificial neural networks that are inspired by the human nervous system, there are several types of DL architectures suited to different tasks; convolutional neural networks are particularly adept at extracting valuable information from CVI data. We survey some of the notable applications of DL to tasks across the spectrum of CVI modalities. We also discuss challenges in the development and implementation of DL systems, including avoiding overfitting, preventing systematic bias, improving explainability, and fostering a human-machine partnership. Finally, we conclude with a vision of the future of DL for CVI.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Deep learning has the potential to meaningfully affect the field of CVI. Rather than a threat, DL could be seen as a partner to cardiovascular imagers in reducing technical burden and improving efficiency and quality of care. High-quality prospective evidence is still needed to demonstrate how the benefits of DL CVI systems may outweigh the risks.</p>",

While the problem is complex, it may present an opportunity to improve research, as well as inform public dialogue about what types of mental illness are actually associated with such mass tragedies.</p><h3>Observations</h3><p>Assuring the diagnostic accuracy of those who commit mass violence is challenging due to the retrospective nature of the analysis and lack of reliable psychiatric data. Psychiatric research has begun to use a dimensional approach that may be well suited to the study of mental illness in perpetrators of mass violence. This approach aggregates psychiatric symptoms into 3 domains of psychopathology: (1) internalizing, (2) externalizing, and (3) psychotic experience. This approach has practical clinical use and research support. A dimensional approach may help clear up misconceptions about the rate of psychosis in mass violence perpetrators, as well as reveal the most common dimensions of mental functioning associated with perpetrators.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Improved research methods are needed to clarify and prevent mass violence. More precisely identifying the symptoms and mental turmoil of perpetrators may be associated with improved early identification and prevention. Because adolescence is a critical and formative period in which internalizing and externalizing problems arise, early interventions may have the best chance of reducing future mass violence.</p>",

They were identified using Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services administrative data, Internal Revenue Service filings, Medicare and commercial claims, and other data. Health systems were categorized as academic, public, large for-profit, large nonprofit, or other private systems. Quality of preventive care, chronic disease management, patient experience, low-value care, mortality, hospital readmissions, and spending were assessed for Medicare beneficiaries attributed to system and nonsystem physicians. Prices for physician and hospital services and total spending were assessed in 2018 commercial claims data. Outcomes were adjusted for patient characteristics and geographic area.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>A total of 580 health systems were identified and varied greatly in size. Systems accounted for 40% of physicians and 84% of general acute care hospital beds and delivered primary care to 41% of traditional Medicare beneficiaries. Academic and large nonprofit systems accounted for a majority of system physicians (80%) and system hospital beds (64%). System hospitals were larger than nonsystem hospitals (67% vs 23% with\u2009&gt;100 beds), as were system physician practices (74% vs 12% with\u2009&gt;100 physicians). Performance on measures of preventive care, clinical quality, and patient experience was modestly higher for health system physicians and hospitals than for nonsystem physicians and hospitals. Prices paid to health system physicians and hospitals were significantly higher than prices paid to nonsystem physicians and hospitals (12%-26% higher for physician services, 31% for hospital services). Adjusting for practice size attenuated health systems differences on quality measures, but price differences for small and medium practices remained large.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>In 2018, health system physicians and hospitals delivered a large portion of medical services. Performance on clinical quality and patient experience measures was marginally better in systems but spending and prices were substantially higher. This was especially true for small practices. Small quality differentials combined with large price differentials suggests that health systems have not, on average, realized their potential for better care at equal or lower cost.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h3>Importance</h3><p>Complete information in a trial protocol regarding study outcomes is crucial for obtaining regulatory approvals, ensuring standardized trial conduct, reducing research waste, and providing transparency of methods to facilitate trial replication, critical appraisal, accurate reporting and interpretation of trial results, and knowledge synthesis. However, recommendations on what outcome-specific information should be included are diverse and inconsistent. To improve reporting practices promoting transparent and reproducible outcome selection, assessment, and analysis, a need for specific and harmonized guidance as to what outcome-specific information should be addressed in clinical trial protocols exists.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To develop harmonized, evidence- and consensus-based standards for describing outcomes in clinical trial protocols through integration with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 statement.</p><h3>Evidence Review</h3><p>Using the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) methodological framework, the SPIRIT-Outcomes 2022 extension of the SPIRIT 2013 statement was developed by (1) generation and evaluation of candidate outcome reporting items via consultation with experts and a scoping review of existing guidance for reporting trial outcomes (published within the 10 years prior to March 19, 2018) identified through expert solicitation, electronic database searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Methodology Register, gray literature searches, and reference list searches; (2) a 3-round international Delphi voting process (November 2018-February 2019) completed by 124 panelists from 22 countries to rate and identify additional items; and (3) an in-person consensus meeting (April 9-10, 2019) attended by 25 panelists to identify essential items for outcome-specific reporting to be addressed in clinical trial protocols.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>The scoping review and consultation with experts identified 108 recommendations relevant to outcome-specific reporting to be addressed in trial protocols, the majority (72%) of which were not included in the SPIRIT 2013 statement. All recommendations were consolidated into 56 items for Delphi voting; after the Delphi survey process, 19 items met criteria for further evaluation at the consensus meeting and possible inclusion in the SPIRIT-Outcomes 2022 extension. The discussions during and after the consensus meeting yielded 9 items that elaborate on the SPIRIT 2013 statement checklist items and are related to completely defining and justifying the choice of primary, secondary, and other outcomes (SPIRIT 2013 statement checklist item 12) prospectively in the trial protocol, defining and justifying the target difference between treatment groups for the primary outcome used in the sample size calculations (SPIRIT 2013 statement checklist item 14), describing the responsiveness of the study instruments used to assess the outcome and providing details on the outcome assessors (SPIRIT 2013 statement checklist item 18a), and describing any planned methods to account for multiplicity relating to the analyses or interpretation of the results (SPIRIT 2013 statement checklist item 20a).</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>This SPIRIT-Outcomes 2022 extension of the SPIRIT 2013 statement provides 9 outcome-specific items that should be addressed in all trial protocols and may help increase trial utility, replicability, and transparency and may minimize the risk of selective nonreporting of trial results.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h3>Importance</h3><p>The US faces a pivotal moment of opportunity and risk regarding issues affecting children (aged 0-17 years). Although the US remains the only United Nations member state to not have ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), a child rights framework is essential for child health professionals seeking to advance many issues affecting children in the US. The Reimagining Children\u2019s Rights project (2020-2021) conducted an in-depth environmental scan of relevant literature and policy analysis using the Three Horizons design process to assess strategies that could advance the rights and well-being of children in the US. The project was overseen by a steering committee and informed by an advisory committee composed of youth leaders and experts in children\u2019s rights, advocacy, health, law, and a range of child-specific issues (eg, youth justice, early childhood development), who provided expert input on strategic considerations for advancing children\u2019s rights.</p><h3>Observations</h3><p>Seven findings about advancing children\u2019s rights in the US are notable, all reflecting current gaps and opportunities for using a whole-child rights framework in the US, even without formal adoption of the CRC. Actionable strategies, tactics, and tools to leverage sustainable change in the multitude of issue areas can advance the current state of children\u2019s rights. High-potential strategies for catalyzing advancement of children\u2019s rights include youth activism, innovations in governance and accountability, legislative action, impact litigation, place-based initiatives, education and public awareness, alignment with other children\u2019s movements, and research. The child rights framework is unifying and adaptive to future unforeseen challenges.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Children\u2019s rights provide a powerful, synergistic framework for child health professionals\u2014in partnership with youth and other leaders\u2014to increase equity and protect the rights and well-being of all children in the US.</p>",

A search of PubMed for peer-reviewed literature and online reports from nonprofit and government organizations was conducted between August 1, 2021, and February 1, 2022, to review evidence on Medicaid managed care, delivery system reforms, expansion, and health disparities. Peer-reviewed articles and reports published between January 2003 and February 2022 were included.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>Medicaid covered approximately 80.6 million people (mean per month) in 2022 (24.2% of the US population) and accounted for an estimated $671.2 billion in health spending in 2020, representing 16.3% of US health spending. Medicaid accounted for an estimated 27.2% of total state spending and 7.6% of total federal expenditures in 2021. States enrolled 69.5% of Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care plans in 2019 and adopted 139 delivery system reforms from 2003 to 2019. The 38 states (and Washington, DC) that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act experienced gains in coverage, increased federal revenues, and improvements in health care access and some health outcomes. Approximately 56.4% of Medicaid beneficiaries were from racial and ethnic minority groups in 2019, and disparities in access, quality, and outcomes are common among these groups within Medicaid. Expanding Medicaid, addressing disparities within Medicaid, and having an explicit focus on equity in managed care and delivery system reforms may represent opportunities for Medicaid to advance health equity.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Medicaid insures a substantial portion of the US population, accounts for a significant amount of total health spending and state expenditures, and has evolved with delivery system reforms, increased managed care enrollment, and state expansions. Additional Medicaid policy reforms are needed to reduce health disparities by race and ethnicity and to help achieve equity in access, quality, and outcomes.</p>",

Most people affected by PD live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and experience large inequalities in access to neurological care and essential medicines. This Special Communication describes 6 actions steps that are urgently needed to address global disparities in PD.</p><h3>Observations</h3><p>The adoption by the 73rd World Health Assembly (WHA) of resolution 73.10 to develop an intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders in consultation with member states was the stimulus to coordinate efforts and leverage momentum to advance the agenda of neurological conditions, such as PD. In April 2021, the Brain Health Unit at the World Health Organization convened a multidisciplinary, sex-balanced, international consultation workshop, which identified 6 workable avenues for action within the domains of disease burden; advocacy and awareness; prevention and risk reduction; diagnosis, treatment, and care; caregiver support; and research.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>The dramatic increase of PD cases in many world regions and the potential costs of PD-associated treatment will need to be addressed to prevent possible health service strain. Across the board, governments, multilateral agencies, donors, public health organizations, and health care professionals constitute potential stakeholders who are urged to make this a priority.</p>",

A primary challenge of parsing PASC epidemiology and pathophysiology is the lack of a standard definition of the syndrome, and little is known regarding mechanisms of neuropsychiatric PASC.</p><h3>Observations</h3><p>Rates of symptom prevalence vary, but at least 1 PASC neuropsychiatric symptom has been reported in as many as 90% of patients 6 months after COVID-19 hospitalization and in approximately 25% of nonhospitalized adults with COVID-19. Mechanisms of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 are still being elucidated. They may include static brain injury accrued during acute COVID-19, neurodegeneration triggered by secondary effects of acute COVID-19, autoimmune mechanisms with chronic inflammation, viral persistence in tissue reservoirs, or reactivation of other latent viruses. Despite rapidly emerging data, many gaps in knowledge persist related to the variable definitions of PASC, lack of standardized phenotyping or biomarkers, variability in virus genotypes, ascertainment biases, and limited accounting for social determinants of health and pandemic-related stressors.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Growing data support a high prevalence of PASC neuropsychiatric symptoms, but the current literature is heterogeneous with variable assessments of critical epidemiological factors. By enrolling large patient samples and conducting state-of-the-art assessments, the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER), a multicenter research initiative funded by the National Institutes of Health, will help clarify PASC epidemiology, pathophysiology, and mechanisms of injury, as well as identify targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>",

Understanding the scale and profile of the disease is vital to concentrate and reinforce global prevention efforts.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To examine global patterns of cutaneous melanoma in 2020 and to provide projected estimates of cases and deaths by 2040.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>This population-based study used the GLOBOCAN 2020 database for global epidemiological assessment of new cases and deaths due to invasive melanoma.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>Age-standardized incidence and mortality rates were calculated per 100\u202f000 person-years by country, world region, and 4-tier level of human development. Estimated numbers of cases and deaths were calculated for the year 2040.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>A worldwide total of 325\u202f000 new melanoma cases (174\u202f000 males, 151\u202f000 females) and 57\u202f000 deaths (32\u202f000 males, 25\u202f000 females) was estimated for 2020. Large geographic variations existed across countries and world regions, with the highest incidence rates among males (42 per 100\u202f000 person-years) and females (31 per 100\u202f000 person-years) observed in Australia/New Zealand, followed by Western Europe (19 per 100\u202f000 person-years for males and females), North America (18 per 100\u202f000 person-years for males, 14 per 100\u202f000 person-years for females), and Northern Europe (17 per 100\u202f000 person-years for males, 18 per 100\u202f000 person-years for females). Melanoma continued to be rare in most African and Asian countries, with incidence rates commonly less than 1 per 100\u202f000 person-years. Mortality rates peaked at 5 per 100\u202f000 person-years in New Zealand, and geographic variations were less pronounced than for incidence. Melanoma was more frequent among males than females in most world regions. If 2020 rates continue, the burden from melanoma is estimated to increase to 510\u202f000 new cases (a roughly 50% increase) and to 96\u202f000 deaths (a 68% increase) by 2040.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>This epidemiological assessment suggests that melanoma remains an important challenge to cancer control and public health globally, especially in fair-skinned populations of European descent.</p>",

Estimates are also provided by quintiles of the SDI, a composite measure of educational attainment, income per capita, and total fertility rate for those younger than 25 years. Estimates include 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>In 2019, there were an estimated 23.6 million (95% UI, 22.2-24.9 million) new cancer cases (17.2 million when excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 10.0 million (95% UI, 9.36-10.6 million) cancer deaths globally, with an estimated 250 million (235-264 million) DALYs due to cancer. Since 2010, these represented a 26.3% (95% UI, 20.3%-32.3%) increase in new cases, a 20.9% (95% UI, 14.2%-27.6%) increase in deaths, and a 16.0% (95% UI, 9.3%-22.8%) increase in DALYs. Among 22 groups of diseases and injuries in the GBD 2019 study, cancer was second only to cardiovascular diseases for the number of deaths, years of life lost, and DALYs globally in 2019. Cancer burden differed across SDI quintiles. The proportion of years lived with disability that contributed to DALYs increased with SDI, ranging from 1.4% (1.1%-1.8%) in the low SDI quintile to 5.7% (4.2%-7.1%) in the high SDI quintile. While the high SDI quintile had the highest number of new cases in 2019, the middle SDI quintile had the highest number of cancer deaths and DALYs. From 2010 to 2019, the largest percentage increase in the numbers of cases and deaths occurred in the low and low-middle SDI quintiles.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>The results of this systematic analysis suggest that the global burden of cancer is substantial and growing, with burden differing by SDI. These results provide comprehensive and comparable estimates that can potentially inform efforts toward equitable cancer control around the world.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction after exposure to severe psychological trauma. Traumatic events that may precipitate PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural and human-made disasters, and exposure to military combat or warfare. There is a growing body of evidence for associations of PTSD with major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as hypertension and diabetes, as well as with major CVD outcomes, such as myocardial infarction and heart failure. However, it is unclear whether these associations are causal or confounded. Furthermore, the biological and behavioral mechanisms underlying these associations are poorly understood. Here, the available evidence on the association of PTSD with CVD from population, basic, and genomic research as well as from clinical and translational research are reviewed, seeking to identify major research gaps, barriers, and opportunities in knowledge acquisition and technology as well as research tools to support and accelerate critical research for near-term and longer-term translational research directions. Large-scale, well-designed prospective studies, capturing diverse and high-risk populations, are warranted that include uniform phenotyping of PTSD as well as broad assessment of biological and behavioral risk factors and CVD outcomes. Available evidence from functional brain imaging studies demonstrates that PTSD pathophysiology includes changes in specific anatomical brain regions and circuits, and studies of immune system function in individuals with PTSD suggest its association with enhanced immune inflammatory activity. However, establishment of animal models and human tissue biobanks is also warranted to elucidate the potential causal connection of PTSD-induced brain changes and/or inflammation with CVD pathophysiology. Emerging large-scale genome-wide association studies of PTSD will provide an opportunity to conduct mendelian randomization studies that test hypotheses regarding the presence, magnitude, and direction of causal associations between PTSD and CVD outcomes. By identifying research gaps in epidemiology and genomics, animal, and human translational research, opportunities to better justify and design future interventional trials are highlighted that may test whether treatment of PTSD or underlying neurobiological or immune dysregulation may improve or prevent CVD risk or outcomes.</p>",

The prevalences of prediabetes and diabetes are higher in older adults. Estimates of the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes vary widely, perhaps because of differences in the definition of prediabetes or the heterogeneity of prediabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure and new cases of blindness among adults in the US. It is also associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and was estimated to be the seventh leading cause of death in the US in 2017. Screening asymptomatic adults for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes may allow earlier detection, diagnosis, and treatment, with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomes.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To update its 2015 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults and preventive interventions for those with prediabetes.</p><h3>Population</h3><p>Nonpregnant adults aged 35 to 70 years seen in primary care settings who have overweight or obesity (defined as a body mass index \u226525 and \u226530, respectively) and no symptoms of diabetes.</p><h3>Evidence Assessment</h3><p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and offering or referring patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions has a moderate net benefit.</p><h3>Conclusions and Recommendation</h3><p>The USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity.

            "content_html": "<h3>Importance</h3><p>Extenuating circumstances can trigger unplanned changes to randomized trials and introduce methodological, ethical, feasibility, and analytical challenges that can potentially compromise the validity of findings. Numerous randomized trials have required changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but guidance for reporting such modifications is incomplete.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>As a joint extension for the CONSORT and SPIRIT reporting guidelines, CONSERVE (CONSORT and SPIRIT Extension for RCTs Revised in Extenuating Circumstances) aims to improve reporting of trial protocols and completed trials that undergo important modifications in response to extenuating circumstances.</p><h3>Evidence</h3><p>A panel of 37 international trial investigators, patient representatives, methodologists and statisticians, ethicists, funders, regulators, and journal editors convened to develop the guideline. The panel developed CONSERVE following an accelerated, iterative process between June 2020 and February 2021 involving (1) a rapid literature review of multiple databases (OVID Medline, OVID EMBASE, and EBSCO CINAHL) and gray literature sources from 2003 to March 2021; (2) consensus-based panelist meetings using a modified Delphi process and surveys; and (3) a global survey of trial stakeholders.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>The rapid review yielded 41\u202f673 citations, of which 38 titles were relevant, including emerging guidance from regulatory and funding agencies for managing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on trials. However, no generalizable guidance for all circumstances in which trials and trial protocols might face unanticipated modifications were identified. The CONSERVE panel used these findings to develop a consensus reporting guidelines following 4 rounds of meetings and surveys. Responses were received from 198 professionals from 34 countries, of whom 90% (n\u2009=\u2009178) indicated that they understood the concept definitions and 85.4% (n\u2009=\u2009169) indicated that they understood and could use the implementation tool. Feedback from survey respondents was used to finalize the guideline and confirm that the guideline\u2019s core concepts were applicable and had utility for the trial community. CONSERVE incorporates an implementation tool and checklists tailored to trial reports and trial protocols for which extenuating circumstances have resulted in important modifications to the intended study procedures. The checklists include 4 sections capturing extenuating circumstances, important modifications, responsible parties, and interim data analyses.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>CONSERVE offers an extension to CONSORT and SPIRIT that could improve the transparency, quality, and completeness of reporting important modifications to trials in extenuating circumstances such as COVID-19.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h3>Importance</h3><p>Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, with an estimated 52\u202f980 persons in the US projected to die of colorectal cancer in 2021. Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed among persons aged 65 to 74 years. It is estimated that 10.5% of new colorectal cancer cases occur in persons younger than 50 years. Incidence of colorectal cancer (specifically adenocarcinoma) in adults aged 40 to 49 years has increased by almost 15% from 2000-2002 to 2014-2016. In 2016, 26% of eligible adults in the US had never been screened for colorectal cancer and in 2018, 31% were not up to date with screening.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults 40 years or older. The review also examined whether these findings varied by age, sex, or race/ethnicity. In addition, as in 2016, the USPSTF commissioned a report from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network Colorectal Cancer Working Group to provide information from comparative modeling on how estimated life-years gained, colorectal cancer cases averted, and colorectal cancer deaths averted vary by different starting and stopping ages for various screening strategies.</p><h3>Population</h3><p>Asymptomatic adults 45 years or older at average risk of colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer [such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis]).</p><h3>Evidence Assessment</h3><p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years has substantial net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years who have been previously screened has small net benefit. Adults who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in all adults aged 50 to 75 years. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of screening all persons in this age group is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the patient\u2019s overall health, prior screening history, and preferences.
