This study evaluates whether AI\u2013augmented decision-making is non-\ninferior to standard decision-making when selecting participants for invasive\ncoronary angiography following stress echocardiography.\n\n### Methods\n\nPROTEUS was a multicenter, parallel-group randomized controlled trial. We\nenrolled participants undergoing a stress echocardiogram at 20 centers across\nthe United Kingdom between November 2021 and June 2023. Participants were\nrandomly assigned to standard clinical decision-making (control) or decision-\nmaking augmented by AI (intervention). The primary end point was appropriate\nreferral for coronary angiography, with true positives defined as severe\ncoronary disease requiring revascularization in participants referred for\ninvasive angiography and false negatives defined as an acute coronary event\nwithin 6 months. Secondary analysis examined intervention versus control in\nprespecified subgroups where interpretation is known to be more challenging.\n\n### Results\n\nOut of 2341 randomly assigned participants, 2213 (94.53%) completed 6 months\u2019\nfollow-up. Eighty-five participants were referred for angiography, 61 of whom\nhad significant coronary disease. Of the participants not referred, 41\nparticipants had acute coronary syndrome or died within 6 months. The\ndifference between the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(AUROC) for the intervention (0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43 to\n0.83) and control (0.55; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.80), did not meet the prespecified\nnon-inferiority margin of \u22120.05 (difference, 0.09; 95% CI, \u22120.22 to 0. 39).\nThe sensitivity in the intervention (64.2%; 95% CI, 33.3 to 80.0%) and control\n(55.1%; 95% CI, 43.7 to 84.2%) was similar (difference, 9.1%; 95% CI, \u221221.8 to\n39.6%). Likewise, the specificity in the intervention (98.6%; 95% CI, 98.1 to\n99.8%) and control (99.2%; 95% CI, 97.2 to 99.5%) was similar (difference,\n0.6%; 95% CI, \u22122.1 to 0.9%). Subgroup analyses suggest potential benefit of\nAI\u2013augmentation in low-volume stress echocardiography centers.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nAI\u2013augmented decision-making in stress echocardiography did not meet the non-\ninferiority end point when evaluated in a large, prospective randomized\ncontrolled trial, but may be beneficial in low-volume centers.

This study evaluates whether AI\u2013augmented decision-making is non-inferior to standard decision-making when selecting participants for invasive coronary angiography following stress echocardiography.</div></section><section id=\"abs-sec-2\"><h3>Methods</h3><div role=\"paragraph\">PROTEUS was a multicenter, parallel-group randomized controlled trial. We enrolled participants undergoing a stress echocardiogram at 20 centers across the United Kingdom between November 2021 and June 2023. Participants were randomly assigned to standard clinical decision-making (control) or decision-making augmented by AI (intervention). The primary end point was appropriate referral for coronary angiography, with true positives defined as severe coronary disease requiring revascularization in participants referred for invasive angiography and false negatives defined as an acute coronary event within 6 months. Secondary analysis examined intervention versus control in prespecified subgroups where interpretation is known to be more challenging.</div></section><section id=\"abs-sec-3\"><h3>Results</h3><div role=\"paragraph\">Out of 2341 randomly assigned participants, 2213 (94.53%) completed 6 months\u2019 follow-up. Eighty-five participants were referred for angiography, 61 of whom had significant coronary disease. Of the participants not referred, 41 participants had acute coronary syndrome or died within 6 months. The difference between the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for the intervention (0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43 to 0.83) and control (0.55; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.80), did not meet the prespecified non-inferiority margin of \u22120.05 (difference, 0.09; 95% CI, \u22120.22 to 0. 39). The sensitivity in the intervention (64.2%; 95% CI, 33.3 to 80.0%) and control (55.1%; 95% CI, 43.7 to 84.2%) was similar (difference, 9.1%; 95% CI, \u221221.8 to 39.6%). Likewise, the specificity in the intervention (98.6%; 95% CI, 98.1 to 99.8%) and control (99.2%; 95% CI, 97.2 to 99.5%) was similar (difference, 0.6%; 95% CI, \u22122.1 to 0.9%). Subgroup analyses suggest potential benefit of AI\u2013augmentation in low-volume stress echocardiography centers.</div></section><section id=\"abs-sec-4\"><h3>Conclusions</h3><div role=\"paragraph\">AI\u2013augmented decision-making in stress echocardiography did not meet the non-inferiority end point when evaluated in a large, prospective randomized controlled trial, but may be beneficial in low-volume centers.

AI models require training with large numbers of examples, which\nare only available for common diseases. In clinical reality, however, the\nmajority of diseases are less frequent, and current AI models overlook or\nmisclassify them. An effective, comprehensive technique is needed for the full\nspectrum of real-world diagnoses.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe collected two large real-world datasets of gastrointestinal (GI) biopsies,\nwhich are prototypical of the problem. Herein, the 10 most common findings\naccounted for approximately 90% of cases, whereas the remaining 10% contained\n56 disease entities, including many cancers. Seventeen million histological\nimages from 5423 cases were used for training and evaluation. We propose a\ndeep anomaly detection (AD) approach that only requires training data from\ncommon diseases to also detect all less frequent diseases.\n\n### Results\n\nWithout specific training for the diseases, our best-performing model reliably\ndetected a broad spectrum of infrequent (\u201canomalous\u201d) pathologies with 95.0%\n(stomach) and 91.0% (colon) area under the receiver operating characteristic\ncurve (AUROC) and was able to generalize between scanners and hospitals.\nCancers were detected with 97.7% (stomach) and 96.9% (colon) AUROC.

The proposed novel AD can flag anomalous\ncases, facilitate case prioritization, and reduce missed diagnoses, providing\ncritical support for pathologists. By design, it can be expected to detect any\npathological alteration including rare primary or metastatic cancers in GI\nbiopsies.
